# Hotel Operations

LuxurStay Hotels is a major, international chain of hotels. They offer hotels for both business and leisure travellers in major cities across the world. The chain prides themselves on the level of customer service that they offer. 

However, the management has been receiving complaints about slow room service in some hotel branches. As these complaints are impacting the customer satisfaction rates, it has become a serious issue. Recent data shows that customer satisfaction has dropped from the 4.5 rating that they expect. 

You are working with the Head of Operations to identify possible causes and hotel branches with the worst problems.
